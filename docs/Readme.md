Untitled is a JS runtime allowing you to control objects in various combinations and with models or shapes written in C++. 

The only binary executable is the runtime, which actually runs the application, it doesn't contain anything application specific and only executes the scripts. All scripts can be hot reloaded at runtime, which is automatically done when the application window regains focus
