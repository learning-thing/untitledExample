At the moment, only 3D Game objects are supported

2D and Viewmodel 3D are planned.
No shadows (shadowmapping is planned)

Scripts are currently required to set a position for a gameobject
There is no proper editor for the game scene yet.

Multiplay might be hard to implement, there is also no networking at all.


### Plans:
I would really like a better scene system where scenes can have scenes and child objects
basically making "prefabs/packs/subscenes". And also a system for Levels - closely related.
